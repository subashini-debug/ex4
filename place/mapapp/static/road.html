Vandalur Road (or the region around Vandalur, Chennai) is a rapidly growing suburb in the southern part of the Chennai Metropolitan Area. It’s known for its good connectivity — it's at the junction of several major roads like GST Road, Old Mamallapuram Road (OMR), and the Vandalur-Kelambakkam road, making access to IT hubs, schools, hospitals, and commercial areas convenient. One of its standout landmarks is the Arignar Anna Zoological Park, which draws both visitors and residents. Over recent years, residential demand has increased significantly here due to developing infrastructure, availability of amenities, and its relative affordability compared to central parts of Chennai.
